      <description>Jenkins out of the box do not have Role based access support. But when using Jenkins in an organization we need to separate the access to different jenkins pipelines based on the user groups. For example developers should not have the access to production related pipelines.
Fortunately there is a Jenkins plugin called &amp;ldquo;Role-based Authorization Strategy&amp;rdquo; to facilitate exactly this. It has bit of a complex workflow, but it provides the feature we need :).</description>
