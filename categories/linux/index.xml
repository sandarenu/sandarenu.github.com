      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve being using Linux as my primary OS for about 6 years.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m doing programming all the time, I use shell all the time to perform various task from compiling to commiting code. First I used the normal Terminal comes with Ubuntu
and then for about three years I&amp;rsquo;ve being using Terminator. Terminator is better than normal terminal since it has split screen feature. But no matter what the frontend, underneath
It is still the BASH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resently I came accross a new Shell, ZSH !. Well it is not a new thing, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t came accorss it before. I&amp;rsquo;ve to say that ZSH is far better than BASH. It has some really cool features. There is a very nice project called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh&#34;&gt;oh my zsh&lt;/a&gt; which is a community driven framework to manage zsh configurations. You can use &lt;code&gt;oh-my-zsh&lt;/code&gt; to install ZSH as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To installing ZSH just execute following command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will download and setup zsh as well as scripts related to oh-my-zsh. Above itself tryies to change your default shell to zsh as well, but in my machine that part failed. In case if that happens use following to set it mannually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;chsh -s /bin/zsh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what makes ZSH better than BASH?, well there are many reason. I&amp;rsquo;ve listed some of them below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful context based tab completion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pattern matching/globbing on alien steroids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Themeable prompts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loadable modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good spelling correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing of command history among all running shells (sometimes this can be annoying as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global aliases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the GIT integration; I can see the current branch I&amp;rsquo;m working on and wether it is dirty or not directly from the terminal.
